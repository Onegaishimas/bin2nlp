# Feature PRD: RESTful API Interface

## Feature Overview

### Feature Name and Description
**RESTful API Interface** - A comprehensive HTTP API that provides programmatic access to the bin2nlp binary analysis system. This interface serves as the primary gateway for users to submit binary files for analysis, retrieve results, and manage analysis operations through standard REST endpoints with automatic OpenAPI documentation.

### Problem Statement
Developers and security professionals need a standardized, programmatic way to integrate binary analysis capabilities into their existing workflows and tools. Manual analysis processes and proprietary interfaces create barriers to automation and limit the ability to scale binary analysis operations across development and security teams.

### Feature Goals and User Value Proposition
- **Programmatic Access**: Enable automated integration of binary analysis into CI/CD pipelines and security workflows
- **Standard Interface**: Provide REST API following industry conventions for easy adoption
- **Flexible Usage**: Support both quick analysis for small files and robust processing for large binaries
- **Developer Experience**: Automatic API documentation and clear error handling for efficient integration
- **Scalable Design**: Architecture supporting future multi-tenant and enterprise features

### Connection to Overall Project Objectives
This API interface directly enables the primary project goals by providing:
- Automated access reducing manual analysis time by 90% (Primary Goal #2)
- Foundation for SaaS commercialization with standard API patterns (Primary Goal #4)
- Quality analysis delivery through structured, machine-readable responses (Primary Goal #3)
- Technical feasibility demonstration through working prototype validation (Primary Goal #1)

- How should API key rotation and security events be handled?

### Design Decisions Requiring Validation

**API Response Design:**
- What level of detail should be included in summary responses?
- How should large analysis results be paginated or chunked?
- What caching strategies provide the best performance vs. freshness balance?

**Error Handling Standards:**
- What error codes and messages provide the most helpful developer experience?
- How should partial failures be communicated (e.g., some analysis succeeded, some failed)?
- What retry strategies should be recommended for different error types?

**Monitoring and Observability:**
- What metrics are most important for API health and performance monitoring?
- How should API usage analytics be collected and reported?
- What alerting thresholds provide early warning without noise?
