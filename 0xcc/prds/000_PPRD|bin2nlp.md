# Project PRD: Binary Decompilation & LLM Translation Service (bin2nlp)

## Project Overview

### Project Name and Description
**bin2nlp** - Multi-LLM Binary Decompilation and Translation API Service that transforms binary reverse engineering from a manual, time-intensive process into an automated decompilation and multi-provider natural language translation system, leveraging OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and Ollama LLM providers to provide rich, human-readable explanations of binary functionality as structured data for external analysis tools.

### Vision Statement
To democratize binary understanding by providing an automated decompilation and multi-LLM translation service that converts binary code into rich, structured natural language explanations using multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama), creating high-quality raw datasets that power external analysis tools, security scanners, code quality assessments, and documentation systems.

### Problem Statement and Opportunity
Organizations and developers need structured, human-readable data about binary functionality for various analysis purposes, but current solutions force them to build complete analysis systems rather than focusing on their core expertise:
- **Data Scarcity:** Analysis tools lack high-quality, structured input data describing what binaries actually do in human terms
- **Expertise Barriers:** Converting assembly code to meaningful explanations requires specialized reverse engineering skills that most teams lack
- **Reinventing Decompilation:** Security tools, code quality systems, and documentation generators all need the same basic binary-to-language translation capability
- **Integration Complexity:** Existing tools provide either raw assembly or completed analysis, not the rich translated datasets needed for specialized analysis
- **Translation Inconsistency:** Manual interpretation of binary behavior varies widely between analysts and tools, preventing reliable automation

### Success Definition and Key Outcomes
**Primary Success:** Create a robust multi-LLM decompilation and translation service that generates high-quality, structured datasets combining assembly code with rich natural language explanations from multiple AI providers, enabling external tools to focus on specialized analysis rather than basic binary understanding.

**Key Outcomes:**
- Transform hours/days of manual binary interpretation into minutes of automated decompilation + multi-LLM translation
- Provide rich, structured datasets from multiple LLM providers that power security analysis, code quality tools, and documentation systems
- Enable developers to build specialized analysis tools without reverse engineering expertise
- Create standardized binary-to-language translation with provider flexibility that external tools can reliably consume
- Establish foundation for production-ready multi-LLM translation service with provider fallback and cost optimization
