# Feature PRD: Binary Decompilation Engine

## Feature Overview

### Feature Name and Description
**Binary Decompilation Engine (BDE)** - A focused decompilation engine that provides cross-platform support for extracting assembly code from executable files, libraries, and mobile applications using radare2 as the core reverse engineering tool. This engine serves as the foundational component for generating structured datasets that combine raw assembly code with rich natural language explanations via multi-LLM provider integration.

### Problem Statement
External analysis tools (security scanners, code quality systems, documentation generators) need high-quality, structured datasets describing what binaries actually do in both technical and human terms. Current tools either provide raw assembly or completed analysis, but not the rich translated datasets needed for specialized analysis. Teams waste development time building basic decompilation capabilities instead of focusing on their core analysis expertise.

### Feature Goals and User Value Proposition
- **Automated Analysis**: Transform manual binary reverse engineering into automated, repeatable processes
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Handle Windows, Linux, macOS, and mobile binary formats consistently
- **Structured Output**: Provide machine-readable analysis results suitable for further processing
- **Error Resilience**: Robust handling of corrupted, packed, or unusual binary files
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient analysis suitable for integration into development workflows

### Connection to Overall Project Objectives
This engine directly supports the primary project goal of democratizing binary analysis by providing the core technical foundation that enables:
- Automated reverse engineering workflows (Primary Goal #1)
- 90% time reduction vs manual analysis (Primary Goal #2) 
- High-quality analysis insights (Primary Goal #3)
- Scalable architecture for future SaaS deployment (Primary Goal #4)

- CPU optimization for concurrent analysis operations
- I/O efficiency for file processing and temporary storage
- Resource cleanup and garbage collection optimization

**Container Integration Challenges:**
- Security restrictions and sandboxing requirements
- Resource limit enforcement and monitoring
- Inter-container communication for distributed processing
- Container health monitoring and recovery

### Resource and Timeline Estimates

**Development Timeline:**
- Week 1: Core foundation and basic integration (40 hours)
- Week 2: Full decompilation engine implementation (40 hours)
- Week 3: Translation context and LLM preparation features (35 hours)
- Week 4: Integration, optimization, and comprehensive testing (25 hours)
- Week 5: Translation-ready dataset validation and refinement (20 hours)
- **Total Estimate: 160 hours over 5 weeks**

**Resource Requirements:**
- 1 senior developer for radare2 integration and core engine
- Access to diverse binary file samples for testing
- Development environment with Docker and radare2 setup
- Performance testing infrastructure for benchmarking

**Risk Mitigation Timeline:**
- Week 1: Early radare2 integration testing to identify stability issues
- Week 2: Performance baseline establishment and optimization planning
- Week 3: Concurrent processing testing and resource limit validation
- Week 4: Comprehensive integration testing and edge case validation

## Open Questions

### Technical Decisions Requiring Research

**radare2 Version Management:** ✅ **RESOLVED**
- **Strategy**: Use latest stable radare2 release (floating version)
- **Rationale**: Prioritize latest features and security fixes for prototype phase
- **Update Approach**: Automatic updates with container rebuild and testing
- **Fallback**: Previous stable version as backup container image

**Performance Optimization:**
- Should analysis be parallelized within radare2 or at the engine level?
- What caching strategies would be most effective for repeated analysis?
- How should memory usage be optimized for very large binary files?

### Business Decisions Pending Input

**Analysis Depth Configuration:**
- What specific configuration options should be exposed to users?
- How should analysis depth affect processing time and resource usage?
- What default settings provide the best balance of speed and completeness?

**Error Handling Policies:**
- How aggressive should early file rejection be for edge cases?
- What level of partial results should be returned when analysis fails?
- How should analysis timeouts be communicated and handled?

### Design Decisions Requiring Validation

**Security Pattern Detection:**
- What specific security patterns should be prioritized for detection?
- How should confidence scores be calculated and calibrated?
- What false positive rates are acceptable for different pattern types?

**Output Format Design:**
- How detailed should function analysis results be by default?
- What metadata is most valuable for downstream LLM processing?
- How should analysis results be versioned for compatibility?
