üîç REDIS Mentions
Redis Infrastructure Components:

src/cache/base.py - Core Redis client and connection management
src/cache/job_queue.py - Job queue implementation using Redis sorted sets and hashes
src/cache/rate_limiter.py - Rate limiting system with Redis sliding window implementation
src/cache/result_cache.py - Analysis result caching with Redis TTL management
src/cache/session.py - Session management using Redis for temporary file metadata
tests/unit/cache/test_*.py - Comprehensive test suites for all Redis components

Redis Usage Patterns:

Job Management: Priority queues using ZADD, ZPOPMIN for job scheduling
Rate Limiting: Sliding window counters with sorted sets (ZRANGEBYSCORE, ZREMRANGEBYSCORE)
Result Caching: Hash storage with automatic TTL cleanup (HSET, EXPIRE)
Session Tracking: Upload session metadata and temporary file management
Health Monitoring: Redis connection health checks and circuit breaker patterns

Redis Configuration:

Database connection settings in src/core/config.py
Connection pooling and timeout management
Pipeline operations for batch processing
Atomic operations using Redis transactions and Lua scripts

üìä Analysis Mentions
Analysis Engine Components:

src/analysis/engines/radare2.py - Binary decompilation using radare2
src/analysis/engines/security.py - Security pattern detection engine
src/analysis/processors/security_scanner.py - Comprehensive security analysis
src/analysis/processors/job_processor.py - Analysis job orchestration
src/analysis/workers/analysis_worker.py - Background analysis processing

Analysis Data Models:

Analysis Results: Structured output models for decompilation results
Analysis Configuration: Depth levels (quick, standard, comprehensive)
Analysis Jobs: Job metadata and processing state management
Analysis Metrics: Performance and quality tracking

Analysis API Endpoints:

Analysis Submission: /api/v1/decompile for job creation
Analysis Retrieval: Result fetching with different detail levels
Analysis Status: Job progress and completion tracking
Analysis Management: User access control and result filtering

Analysis LLM Integration:

src/llm/prompts/string_interpretation.py - Advanced string analysis prompts
src/llm/providers/gemini_provider.py - Competitive analysis parsing
Function Analysis: Natural language translation of assembly code
Security Analysis: Threat intelligence and risk assessment
String Analysis: Cryptographic and linguistic pattern detection

Analysis Processing Pipeline:

File Validation ‚Üí Decompilation ‚Üí LLM Translation ‚Üí Result Assembly
Security Scanning: Multi-stage threat detection
Performance Analysis: Resource usage and optimization
Quality Assurance: Result validation and confidence scoring

üéØ Key Architectural Patterns
Redis as Primary Storage:

Job Queue: All analysis jobs managed through Redis priority queues
Result Cache: Decompilation results cached for reuse
Rate Limiting: User request quotas enforced via Redis counters
Session Management: Upload sessions and temporary file tracking

Analysis as Core Function:

Binary Decompilation: Primary service offering using radare2
LLM Translation: Natural language explanation of assembly code
Security Assessment: Threat analysis and risk scoring
Multi-Provider LLM: OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini integration for analysis

The system is fundamentally built around Redis for data management and Analysis for core functionality, with comprehensive integration between caching, job processing, and analysis workflows.
