Perfect! Let me mark the configuration task as complete and provide a summary of
  what we've accomplished:

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Read and replace src/cache/session.py with hybrid PostgreSQL implementation
     ☒ Replace src/cache/rate_limiter.py with hybrid PostgreSQL implementation
     ☒ Update src/cache/__init__.py for hybrid system
     ☒ Update core configuration files
     ☐ Update API layers for hybrid storage
     ☐ Clean up remaining Redis references

● ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  Completed comprehensive transformation of core configuration system from
  Redis-centric to PostgreSQL + File Storage hybrid architecture. This involved
  replacing DatabaseSettings from Redis configuration to PostgreSQL settings,
  migrating CacheSettings to StorageSettings for file-based storage, updating all
  environment variable patterns, and modernizing exception handling to use
  StorageException instead of CacheException while maintaining backward compatibility
  through aliases.
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

  ✅ Core Configuration Files Updated Successfully

  I have successfully completed the transformation of the core configuration system
  from Redis-based to PostgreSQL + File Storage hybrid architecture:

  📋 Completed Configuration Updates (R11-R13)

  ✅ Task R11: Updated src/core/config.py (1,306 lines)
  - Replaced DatabaseSettings: Converted from Redis configuration (host, port, db,
  password) to PostgreSQL configuration (host, port, name, user, password, pool
  settings)
  - Replaced CacheSettings: Migrated to StorageSettings with file-based storage
  configuration (base_path, cache_ttl_hours, compression, cleanup intervals)
  - Updated Environment Variables: Changed from REDIS_* prefixes to DATABASE_* and
  STORAGE_* prefixes
  - Fixed Computed Properties: Updated redis_url to database_url with proper
  PostgreSQL connection string
  - Updated Validation: Modified environment checks to validate PostgreSQL instead of
  Redis dependencies
  - Regenerated Example Config: Updated .env.example template with PostgreSQL and
  storage settings

  ✅ Task R12: Updated src/core/exceptions.py (852 lines)
  - Replaced CacheException: Created new StorageException class for database and file
  storage errors
  - Added Database-Specific Exceptions: DatabaseConnectionError and
  DatabaseTimeoutError for PostgreSQL issues
  - Maintained Backward Compatibility: Added aliases (CacheException = 
  StorageException) for existing code
  - Updated Exception Handling: Modified retry logic and HTTP status mapping to use
  new storage exceptions

  🔧 Technical Architecture Changes

  1. Database Configuration Migration:
  # OLD: Redis settings
  REDIS_HOST=localhost
  REDIS_PORT=6379
  REDIS_DB=0

  # NEW: PostgreSQL settings  
  DATABASE_HOST=localhost
  DATABASE_PORT=5432
  DATABASE_NAME=bin2nlp
  DATABASE_USER=bin2nlp
  DATABASE_PASSWORD=bin2nlp_password
  2. Storage Configuration Introduction:
  # NEW: File-based storage settings
  STORAGE_BASE_PATH=/var/lib/app/data
  STORAGE_CACHE_TTL_HOURS=24
  STORAGE_MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=100
  STORAGE_ENABLE_COMPRESSION=true
  3. Exception Hierarchy Modernization:
  # OLD: Redis-specific exceptions
  class CacheException(BinaryAnalysisException): ...

  # NEW: Generic storage exceptions  
  class StorageException(BinaryAnalysisException): ...
  class DatabaseConnectionError(StorageException): ...

  📊 Configuration System Benefits

  - ✅ Unified Configuration: Single configuration system for both PostgreSQL and file
   storage
  - ✅ Environment Variable Consistency: Clear prefixes (DATABASE_*, STORAGE_*) for
  logical grouping
  - ✅ Backward Compatibility: Existing code continues to work with exception aliases
  - ✅ Production Ready: Proper validation, health checks, and error handling
  - ✅ Developer Friendly: Comprehensive example configuration and validation messages

  🎯 Progress Summary

  Core Configuration Transformation: 100% Complete
  - ✅ Configuration Classes: DatabaseSettings and StorageSettings fully implemented
  - ✅ Environment Variables: All Redis references replaced with PostgreSQL/Storage
  equivalents
  - ✅ Exception Handling: Modern storage exception hierarchy with backward
  compatibility
  - ✅ Validation Logic: Updated checks for PostgreSQL dependencies and storage paths
  - ✅ Example Configuration: Complete .env.example template for new architecture

  The configuration system now fully supports the hybrid PostgreSQL + File Storage
  architecture while maintaining clean interfaces and comprehensive error handling.
  All Redis dependencies have been eliminated from the core configuration layer.

  Next Steps: Continue with API layer updates to utilize the new configuration system
  and complete the Redis removal process.

  Redis → PostgreSQL + File Storage Translation Guide:

  1. Storage Architecture:
  # REPLACE Redis-centric language:
  "Cache-first design with TTL-based expiration"

  # WITH Hybrid architecture language:
  "Hybrid PostgreSQL metadata with file-based large payload storage"
  2. Data Persistence:
  # REPLACE:
  "No persistent storage of potentially sensitive binaries"

  # WITH:
  "Metadata persistence in PostgreSQL with automatic TTL cleanup, large payloads in
  file storage with secure deletion"
  3. Performance Characteristics:
  # REPLACE:
  "In-memory operations for fast result retrieval"

  # WITH:
  "Atomic PostgreSQL operations with file system caching for optimal performance"
  4. Deployment Complexity:
  # REPLACE:
  "├── redis-container/        # Redis cache service"

  # WITH:
  "├── database-container/     # PostgreSQL database service"
  5. Dependencies:
  # REPLACE:
  "- `redis>=5.0.0`: Cache and session storage with async support"

  # WITH:
  "- `asyncpg>=0.28.0`: PostgreSQL async driver for database operations
  - `databases[postgresql]>=0.7.0`: Database abstraction layer with connection
  pooling"

    - Update module structure, dependencies, container architecture
    - Most critical since ADR is the foundational reference
  2. Task D02: Project PRD architecture references
    - Update technical dependencies and assumptions
    - Revise infrastructure cost modeling
    - Critical for accurate project specifications

  📝 STANDARDIZED REPLACEMENT PATTERNS PROVIDED:

  The task list includes specific language transformation guides for:
  - Storage Architecture: Cache-first → Hybrid PostgreSQL + File Storage
  - Data Persistence: Volatile Redis → Persistent database with TTL cleanup
  - Performance: In-memory operations → Atomic database operations
  - Dependencies: Redis packages → PostgreSQL + asyncpg packages
  - Container Architecture: Redis containers → Database containers

  ⚡ EXECUTION APPROACH:

  Phase 1 (Days 1-2): Foundation documents (ADR & Project PRD)Phase 2 (Days 3-4):
  Active task references (Master & Phase 1 task lists)Phase 3 (Days 5-6): Supporting
  documents (Feature PRDs, TDDs, TIDs)

  🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA DEFINED:

  - Zero Redis references in any 0xcc/ documents
  - All documents accurately reflect PostgreSQL + File Storage architecture
  - Consistent terminology across all specifications
  - Complete developer clarity from documentation alone

  Ready to begin with Task D01 (ADR Update) - the most critical foundational
  architecture document. This will establish the correct architectural foundation that
   all other documents will reference.
